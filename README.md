# Star-Wars-API
Star Wars API Table
This script retrieves data from the Star Wars API and displays it in a table on a webpage. The table can display either a list of people or a list of films from the Star Wars universe, depending on which button is clicked.

###Installation
Download the script file (data.js) and the HTML file (index.html) and save them in the same directory.
Open the HTML file in your web browser. You should see a table with no data.
