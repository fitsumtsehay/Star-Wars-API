# Star-Wars-API
#### This JavaScript code retrieves data from the Star Wars API and displays it in a table on a webpage. The table can display either a list of people or a list of films from the Star Wars universe, depending on which button is clicked.

### Installation
Download the script file (data.js) and the HTML file (index.html) as well as the CSS file (style.css) and save them in the same directory.
Open the HTML file in your web browser. You should see a table with no data.
To display a table of Star Wars characters, click the "People" button at the top of the page. This will retrieve data from the Star Wars API and display a table of character names, birth years, eye colors, genders, hair colors, heights, masses, and skin colors. To display a table of Star Wars film, click the "Films" button at the top of the page. This will retrieve data from the Star Wars API and display a table of film titles, directors, producers, and release dates.
